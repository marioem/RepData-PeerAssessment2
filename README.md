# Reproducible Data Peer Assessment 2

## Project Report Synopsis
> Present report aims at identifying the severe weather phenomena which have the biggest impact on US population health and result in the greatest economic consequences. The analysis is based on a Storm Data database maintained by  the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA). Due to incomplete representation of NWS's 48 event types across all observed years, the analysis was restricted to years 1993-2011. Results show that among the most dangerous weather phenomena are EXCESSIVE HEAT, TORNADO and HEAT and among the most costy phenomena - FLOOD, DROUGHT and HURRICANE.
